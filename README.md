# **🚀 The Moment You've All Been Patiently Not Waiting For**

The _gloriously_ public version of Reactive Resume is now live at **[https://rxresume.org](https://rxresume.org)**!

No email? No problem! Use a throwaway, your grandma’s AOL address, or just stare at the screen until it lets you in—_your choice_.

---

### **"But What’s the Catch?"** _(Spoiler: There Isn’t One… Probably)_

- ☁️ **Hosted 24/7** in a _~magical~_ cloud VM (read: someone’s basement server with extra fans).
- 💾 **Storage space**: "Plenty"™ (until it’s not—_fingers crossed_).
- ⏳ **Uptime**: Should be always available, minus daily restarts to check for updates (because even servers need coffee breaks).
- 🔙 **Backups**: Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly… _now active!!_ (we’re as excited as you are).
- 📧 **Email**: Optional! Use it only if you _want_ to verify or reset passwords (how _novel_).
- 🖨️ **PDF Export**: _Yes, it actually works...kinda. Still working out a few bugs._ Shockingly, no "Export Failed" screens of despair here, but you do have to allow popups...and use `Letter` format for best results.

---

**Pro Tip:** Don’t thank us—just enjoy your newfound freedom from corporate surveillance disguised as "user verification." 🎉
